    "Ridge regression is a regression which is used to reducd the ovefitting of the model. when we have a large number of indpendent varaibles or when these are highly correlated ols lead to ustable and unreliable coefficient estimates.in ols we find the coefficients for linear equation that minimzes the sum of squared differences. to prevent this we use ridge regression."
