    "2) Hierarichal: for each point it intialize a cluster and find the nearest cluster and keep on doing unitl we get the single cluster. we use dindogram to select the preffered k value.\n",
    "3) DBSCAN: we intialize 3 points each having E radius and we intialize minpoints we intialize red point if it has minipoints greater than intialize, blue if has less than red points and vlue if it has no points(outlier)."
